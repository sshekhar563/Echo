About Me:
I'm passionate about DevOps practices and building efficient CI/CD pipelines. I enjoy working with 
containerization technologies like Docker and orchestration tools like Kubernetes to streamline 
deployment processes. Configuration management and infrastructure as code fascinate me, especially 
using tools like Terraform and Ansible. + GO
