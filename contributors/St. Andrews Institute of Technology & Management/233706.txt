About Me:
I'm passionate about DevOps practices and building efficient CI/CD pipelines. I enjoy working with 
containerization technologies like Docker and orchestration tools like Kubernetes to streamline 
deployment processes. Configuration management and infrastructure as code fascinate me, especially 
using tools like Terraform and Ansible.

I've been exploring Go (Golang) for building scalable backend services and CLI tools. I appreciate 
Go's simplicity, strong concurrency model with goroutines, and how it compiles to a single binary - 
making deployment incredibly straightforward. The language's performance and its growing ecosystem 
for cloud-native applications make it perfect for modern distributed systems.

Currently learning about monitoring and observability using Prometheus and Grafana, and exploring 
GitOps workflows with ArgoCD. I believe in the philosophy of "automate everything" and treating 
infrastructure like software.

Favorite Film: Interstellar
The film's exploration of time, space, and human perseverance resonates deeply. The visual 
representation of black holes and tesseracts, combined with Hans Zimmer's soundtrack, creates 
an unforgettable experience. Plus, the scientific accuracy (mostly!) and emotional depth make 
it a perfect blend of sci-fi and human drama.

Fun Fact: Did you know Velociraptors were actually about the size of a turkey? The ones in 
Jurassic Park were more accurately sized like Deinonychus or Utahraptor!
