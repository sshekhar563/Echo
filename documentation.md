# DOCUMENTATION

### {LooninS} {#58 Time to mine}

- Added chat.go, changed main.go to call chat.go
- chat.go has 3 functions:

```go
connectToEchoServer() // connects to the server, sends the username, printout the server message
getUsername() // gets the username from the user/stdin and returns it as a string
getTimestamp() // returns the current timestamp as a string in the format of "02/01/2006 03:04:05 PM"
```

- go.mod was updated to include the module github.com/gorilla/websocket
- tested the code locally

### {HarshitRSethi} {#67 Getting an Upgrade!}

- Updated server/server.js so that:
  - the first message sent by a client is treated as the username and stored for that connection
  - every message after that is treated as a chat message
  - each message is broadcast to all connected clients
  - messages include a timestamp and the username of the sender
- Updated client/chat.go so that:
  - after sending the username once, the user can continue sending chat messages from the terminal
  - messages received from the server are printed along with timestamps
  - a goroutine is used to listen for incoming messages while the main thread handles user input
- Tested locally with two clients connected to the same server to verify that messages are sent and received correctly, with usernames and timestamps shown as expected

### {Abhineshhh} {#71 Add user prompt for messages}

- Added "Enter Message : " prompt in client/chat.go message input loop
- Fixed server/server.js: moved message handler inside username callback to prevent username broadcast as chat message
- Fixed client/chat.go: implemented ANSI escape codes to reprint prompt after incoming messages for cleaner display

### {IIT2023139} {#79 Feat: Implement Initial TUI Design, Chat Interactivity, and Channel Navigation.}

- Designed a complete TUI interface using Bubble Tea and Lipgloss
- Implemented Login View with input fields for Server, Username, and Password
- Created Chat View with vertical sidebar for channels and message viewport
- Added navigation logic for cycling through channels and inputs
- ensured correct alignment of UI elements and clean message formatting

### {Krishna200608} {#104 Eye Spy}

- Updated client/chat.go:
  - Added getServerAddress() function to capture server URL from user input via stdin.
  - Implemented default fallback to "localhost:8080" if input is empty.
  
- Updated client/main.go:
  - Removed dependency on command-line flags for server address.
  - Reordered logic to prompt for Server Address first, then Username.
- Tested locally: Verified connection sequence with localhost server.
